"Mom--don't you think it's astonishing to be alive?" she began,
Her mother was so surprised that she didn't answer at first, 
Sophie was usually doing her homework when she got home,
"I suppose I do--sometimes," she said,
"Sometimes? Yes, but--don't you think it's astonishing that the world exists at all?"
"Now look, Sophie, Stop talking like that,"
"Why? Perhaps you think the world is quite normal?"
"Well, isn't it? More or less, anyway,"
Sophie saw that the philosopher was right, Grownups took the world for granted, 
They had let themselves be lulled into the enchanted sleep of their humdrum existence once and for all,
"You've just grown so used to the world that nothing surprises you any more,"
"What on earth are you talking about?"
"I'm talking about you getting so used to everything, Totally dim, in other words,"
"I will not be spoken to like that, Sophie!"
"All right, I'll put it another way, You've made yourself comfortable deep down in the fur of a white rabbit that is being pulled out of the universe's top hat right now, 
And in a minute you'll put the potatoes on, Then you'll read the paper and after half an hour's nap you'll watch the news on TV!"
An anxious expression came over her mother's face, She did indeed go into the kitchen and put the potatoes on, 
After a while she came back into the living room, and this time it was she who pushed Sophie into an armchair,
"There's something I must talk to you about," she began, Sophie could tell by her voice that it was something serious,
"You haven't gotten yourself mixed up with drugs, have you, dear?"
Sophie was just about to laugh, but she understood why the question was being brought up now,
"Are you nuts?" she said, "That only makes you duller',"
No more was said that evening about either drugs or white rabbits,
There was no letter for Sophie the next morning, 
All through the interminable day at school she was bored stiff, 
She took care to be extra nice to Joanna during the breaks, 
On the way home they talked about going camping as soon as the woods were dry enough,
After what seemed an eternity she was once again at the mailbox, First she opened a letter postmarked in Mexico, 
It was from her father, He wrote about how much he was longing for home and how for the first time he had managed to beat the Chief Officer at chess, 
Apart from that he had almost finished the pile of books he had brought aboard with him after his winter leave,
And then, there it was--a brown envelope with her name on it! Leaving her schoolbag and the rest of the mail in the house, Sophie ran to the den, 
By philosophy we mean the completely new way of thinking that evolved in Greece about six hundred years before the birth of Christ, 
Until that time people had found answers to all their questions in various religions, 
These religious explanations were handed down from generation to generation in the form of myths, 
A myth is a story about the gods which sets out to explain why life is as it is,
When there is thunder and lightning there is also rain, which was vital to the Viking farmers, So Thor was worshipped as the god of fertility,
The mythological explanation for rain was therefore that Thor was swinging his hammer, And when it rained the corn germinated and thrived in the fields,
How the plants of the field could grow and yield crops was not understood, But it was clearly somehow connected with the rain, 
And since everybody believed that the rain had something to do with Thor, he was one of the most important of the Norse gods,
There was another reason why Thor was important, a reason related to the entire world order,
The Vikings believed that the inhabited world was an island under constant threat from outside dangers, 
They called this part of the world Midgard, which means the kingdom in the middle, Within Midgard lay Asgard, the domain of the gods,
Outside Midgard was the kingdom of Utgard, the domain of the treacherous giants, who resorted to all kinds of cunning tricks to try and destroy the world, 
Evil monsters like these are often referred to as the "forces of chaos," 
Not only in Norse mythology but in almost all other cultures, people found that there was a precarious balance between the forces of good and evil,
One of the ways in which the giants could destroy Midgard was by abducting Freyja, the goddess of fertility, 
If they could do this, nothing would grow in the fields and the women would no longer have children, So it was vital to hold these giants in check,
Thor was a central figure in this battle with the giants, His hammer could do more than make rain; it was a key weapon in the struggle against the dangerous forces of chaos, It gave him almost unlimited power, 
For example, he could hurl it at the giants and slay them, 
And he never had to worry about losing it because it always came back to him, just like a boomerang,
This was the mythological explanation for how the balance of nature was maintained and why there was a constant struggle between good and evil, 
And this was precisely the kind of explanation that the philosophers rejected,
But it was not a question of explanations alone,
Mortals could not just sit idly by and wait for the gods to intervene while catastrophes such as drought or plague loomed, 
They had to act for themselves in the struggle against evil, 
This they did by performing various religious ceremonies, or rites,
The most significant religious ceremony in Norse times was the offering, 
Making an offering to a god had the effect of increasing that god's power, 
For example, mortals had to make offerings to the gods to give them the strength to conquer the forces of chaos, 
They could do this by sacrificing an animal to the god, The offering to Thor was usually a goat, 
Offerings to Odin sometimes took the form of human sacrifices,
The myth that is best known in the Nordic countries comes from the Eddie poem "The Lay of Thrym," 
It tells how Thor, rising from sleep, finds that his hammer is gone, 
This makes him so angry that his hands tremble and his beard shakes, 
Accompanied by his henchman Loki he goes to Freyja to ask if Loki may borrow her wings so that he can fly to Jotunheim, the land of the giants, and find out if they are the ones who have stolen Thor's hammer,
At Jotunheim Loki meets Thrym, the king of the giants, who sure enough begins to boast that he has hidden the hammer seven leagues under the earth, 
And he adds that the gods will not get the hammer back until Thrym is given Freyja as his bride,
Can you picture it, Sophie? Suddenly the good gods find themselves in the midst of a full-blown hostage incident, 
The giants have seized the gods' most vital defensive weapon, 
This is an utterly unacceptable situation, As long as the giants have Thor's hammer, they have total control over the world of gods and mortals, 
In exchange for the hammer they are demanding Freyja, But this is equally unacceptable, 
If the gods have to give up their goddess of fertility--she who protects all life--the grass will disappear from the fields and all gods and mortals will die, The situation is deadlocked,
Loki returns to Asgard, so the myth goes, and tells Freyja to put on her wedding attire for she is (alas!) to wed the king of the giants, 
Freyja is furious, and says people will think she is absolutely man-crazy if she agrees to marry a giant,
Then the god Heimdall has an idea, He suggests that Thor dress up as a bride, With his hair up and two stones under his tunic he will look like a woman, 
Understandably, Thor is not wildly enthusiastic about the idea, but he finally accepts that this is the only way he will ever get his hammer back,
So Thor allows himself to be attired in bridal costume, with Loki as his bridesmaid,
To put it in present-day terms, Thor and Loki are the gods' "anti-terrorist squad," 
Disguised as women, their mission is to breach the giants' stronghold and recapture Thor's hammer,
When the gods arrive at Jotunheim, the giants begin to prepare the wedding feast, 
But during the feast, the bride--Thor, that is--devours an entire ox and eight salmon, He also drinks three barrels of beer, 
This astonishes Thrym, The true identity of the "commandos" is very nearly revealed, 
But Loki manages to avert the danger by explaining that Freyja has been looking forward to coming to jotunheim so much that she has not eaten for a week,
When Thrym lifts the bridal veil to kiss the bride, he is startled to find himself looking into Thor's burning eyes, 
Once again Loki saves the situation by explaining that the bride has not slept for a week because she is so excited about the wedding, 
At this, Thrym commands that the hammer be brought forth and laid in the bride's lap during the wedding ceremony,
Thor roars with laughter when he is given the hammer, 
First he kills Thrym with it, and then he wipes out the giants and all their kin, 
And thus the gruesome hostage affair has a happy ending, Thor--the Batman or James Bond of the gods--has once again conquered the forces of evil,
So much for the myth itself, Sophie, 
But what is the real meaning behind it? 
It wasn't made up just for entertainment, 
The myth also tries to explain something, Here is one possible interpretation:
When a drought occurred, people sought an explanation of why there was no rain, 
Could it be that the giants had stolen Thor's hammer?
Perhaps the myth was an attempt to explain the changing seasons of the year: in the winter Nature dies because Thor's hammer is in jotunheim, 
But in the spring he succeeds in winning it back, 
So the myth tried to give people an explanation for something they could not understand,But a myth was not only an explanation, 
People also carried out religious ceremonies related to the myths, 
We can imagine how people's response to drought or crop failure would be to enact a drama about the events in the myth,
